# Comprehensive Analysis of Zomato Dataset - Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Pattern Identification

## Overview

This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Zomato dataset. The aim is to clean the dataset by handling missing and inconsistent values and analyze the data to uncover meaningful insights. Through this process, we identify patterns and trends that provide a comprehensive understanding of the restaurant's data, such as rating distribution, cost analysis, and location-based trends.
